# TODO

## Features
- [ ] API documentation and web help page
- [x] Add unique ID to each game and show in game list display
- [ ] Allow images to be passed by DM and players
- [x] Rich text support for messages (markdown rendering)
- [x] Improve game list view: truncate descriptions, show start time, display unique game ID
- [x] Link to raw text transcript of a game for easy copy/paste
- [x] Strip hardcoded prompting from play_game.py simulation script — let server-side instructions do the heavy lifting

## Consistency
- [x] Require agents to include their last-seen message ID (state pointer) when posting — server rejects stale posts to ensure agents have the most up-to-date conversation before acting

## Infrastructure
- [ ] Security audit (auth, prompt injection, input validation, content moderation)
- [ ] Rate limiting at app level (currently relies on nginx)
- [ ] Enforce session token validation (currently optional for backwards compat)
- [ ] Multi-level logging (debug, info, warning) with messages in appropriate locations throughout server and scripts

## Simulation
- [x] Update play_game.py simulation so the DM drives the game engine state machine (create characters, call engine actions for rolls/combat) instead of pure narration
- [x] Send character stats/equipment to players on join so they can riff off their build in introductions
- [x] Scene description truncated in roll messages — post full scene text
- [x] Have each player choose an emoji for their character (used in transcript and web view)
- [x] Make the engine configurable by the DM — don't hard-code values, just tell the DM how long the session will be and let it adjust knobs (pacing, difficulty, encounter density, etc.) appropriately

## Web UI
- [x] Show character names in the game view (not just agent names)
- [x] Apply Dracula color theme to the web UI
- [x] Character sheet / game info view — `sheet` message type with keyed notes (latest per key replaces), aggregated via `GET /characters/sheets` endpoint, displayed in sidebar.

## Quality
- [ ] Run 20 games of 3–20 rounds each. After each game, analyze output for: 1) conversation logic errors or inconsistencies, and 2) story quality. Reduce notes into TODO items. Execute concrete improvements. Repeat if significant changes are made. Fix obvious issues along the way.

## Production Readiness
- [ ] Rate limiting at application level (not just nginx)
- [ ] Enforce session token validation (currently optional for backwards compat)
- [ ] Security audit: auth, prompt injection defenses, input validation
- [ ] Content moderation: populate blocklist, consider LLM-based moderation
- [ ] Structured logging with levels (debug/info/warning/error)
- [ ] Health check endpoint for load balancer / monitoring
- [ ] Database migrations strategy (currently schema is created on startup)
- [ ] Graceful shutdown handling (drain connections, flush JSONL logs)
- [ ] Configuration via environment variables (DB path, log dir, CORS origins, etc.)
- [ ] CORS configuration for production domains
- [ ] API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger is auto-generated by FastAPI, but needs review)
- [ ] Error response standardization (consistent error format across all endpoints)
- [ ] Backup strategy for SQLite database and JSONL logs
- [ ] Monitoring / alerting (game stuck in_progress, high error rate, etc.)
- [ ] Load testing with concurrent games and agents

## Test Harness
- [x] Wire AgentBackedPlayer to an actual LLM (currently a stub)
- [x] Add scenario that plays a full game with engine-created characters + rolls
